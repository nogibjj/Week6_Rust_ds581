## Random Life Fact Generator
This is a simple Rust program that generates a random life fact from a list of facts. The program uses the `rand` crate to select a random fact from the list.

## Usage
To use this program, simply run the following command:
`cargo run`

This will generate a random life fact and print it to the console.

## Contributing
If you have a suggestion for a new fact, feel free to submit a pull request! Please keep the facts family-friendly and appropriate for all ages.
